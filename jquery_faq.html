          <h1>Yosemite National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible" id="p1">
            While Yosemite is famous for its stunning granite cliffs and
            waterfalls, it's also home to a grove of ancient giant sequoia trees
            known as the Mariposa Grove. One of the trees in this grove, named
            the "Grizzly Giant," is estimated to be between 1,900 and 2,400
            years old, making it one of the oldest living trees on Earth. These
            giant sequoias are among the largest trees by volume in the world
            and are a remarkable natural wonder within the park.

          <h1>Big Bend National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            Big Bend National Park has a distinctive geographic featureâ€”it forms
            a natural border between the United States and Mexico, following the
            meandering course of the Rio Grande River. This makes it one of the
            few national parks in the world that shares an international
            boundary. Visitors to the park can often see across the river to
            Mexico, and it's a unique aspect of the park's landscape and
            cultural history.

          <h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            Yellowstone National Park is home to the oldest, and one of the most
            picturesque, superintendent's houses of any national park. This
            historic building, known as the "Superintendent's Residence," is
            located at Mammoth Hot Springs and was constructed in 1884. It
            serves as the residence for the park's superintendent and is an
            iconic part of the park's history and architecture.

          <h1>Zion National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            One of the most famous and unique hikes in Zion National Park is
            "The Subway." This hike takes you through a stunning slot canyon
            with narrow passages and turquoise pools. What's interesting is that
            you need a permit to hike "The Subway," and the permit is so sought
            after that it's distributed through a lottery system due to its
            popularity. The unique geology and beauty of "The Subway" make it a
            must-see for many visitors to the park.

          <h1>Rocky Mountain National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            Rocky Mountain National Park boasts Trail Ridge Road, which is the
            highest continuously paved road in the United States. The road
            reaches an elevation of 12,183 feet (3,713 meters) above sea level.
            Traveling along this scenic route provides breathtaking panoramic
            views of the Rocky Mountains, including alpine tundra landscapes,
            wildlife, and an opportunity to experience the dramatic changes in
            elevation within the park. Trail Ridge Road is a popular attraction
            for visitors seeking stunning mountain vistas.

          <h1>Grand Teton National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            Grand Teton National Park is known for its rugged mountain scenery,
            and many of the park's iconic features were shaped by glaciers
            during the last ice age. The Grand Tetons themselves are jagged
            peaks carved by glacial activity. The U-shaped valleys and pristine
            alpine lakes found throughout the park are also evidence of the
            profound glacial influence on the landscape. This glacial history
            has left a lasting mark on the park's stunning natural beauty.

          <h1>Grand Canyon National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            The age of the Grand Canyon is a subject of ongoing scientific
            debate, but the most widely accepted estimate suggests that the
            Colorado River began carving the canyon about 6 million years ago.
            However, the exact timeline and processes involved in its formation
            continue to be a topic of research and discussion among geologists.
            The Grand Canyon's geology and its complex history make it a
            fascinating subject of study for scientists from around the world.

          <h1>Cuyahoga Valley National Park</h1>
          <p class="visible">
            Cuyahoga Valley National Park preserves a portion of the historic
            Ohio & Erie Canal, which played a crucial role in the economic
            development of Ohio and the Midwest in the 19th century. Visitors to
            the park can explore remnants of the canal, including locks and a
            canal towpath, providing a glimpse into the region's transportation
            history. This canal system once facilitated the movement of goods
            and people through the area and contributed to the growth of nearby
            communities.

            Acadia National Park features a popular hiking trail known as the
            Jordan Pond Path. What makes it unique is the tradition of serving
            popovers at the Jordan Pond House, which is located along the trail.
            Hikers often stop at the Jordan Pond House to enjoy these light,
            fluffy pastries with jam and tea while taking in scenic views of
            Jordan Pond and the surrounding mountains. It's a delightful and
            tasty tradition for visitors to the park.

          <p class="visible">
            Olympic National Park is one of the few places in the United States
            where you can find a temperate rainforest. The Hoh Rainforest,
            located within the park, receives an average of 140 to 170 inches
            (3.5 to 4.3 meters) of rainfall annually. This lush, green
            environment is home to unique plant and animal species adapted to
            the high levels of precipitation, making it a fascinating and
            ecologically significant part of the park.
